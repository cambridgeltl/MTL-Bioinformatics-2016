was	O

The	O
result	O
was	O
satisfactory	O
:	O
"	O
The	O
dark	O
greenish	O
poison	O
was	O
oozing	O
slowly	O
from	O
his	O

,	O
which	O
was	O
all	O
contracted	O
and	O
the	O
sharp	O

constant	O
pain	O
extended	O
from	O
the	O
perineum	O
up	O

the	O

"	O
There	O
was	O
a	O
fierce	O
burning	O
sensation	O
in	O
the	O
glands	O
,	O
which	O
prevented	O
him	O
from	O
sleeping	O

Because	O
of	O
this	O

it	O
seemed	O
reasonable	O
to	O
bathe	O

in	O

Malton	O
was	O
blooded	O
regularly	O
besides	O
being	O
given	O
purgatives	O
;	O
the	O
treatment	O
then	O
moved	O
on	O
to	O
the	O
administration	O
of	O
mercury	O
,	O
both	O
internal	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
gums	O
,	O
since	O
it	O
was	O
widely	O
believed	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
that	O
gonorrhoea	O
and	O
syphilis	O
were	O
steps	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
disease	O
,	O
"	O
the	O
Venereal	O
"	O
.	O

Scanagati	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
ruled	O
out	O
the	O
suggestion	O
of	O
syphilitic	O
chancre	O
because	O
Malton	O
'	O
s	O
urine	O
was	O
fine	O
and	O
light	O
with	O
a	O
pungent	O
odour	O
.	O

Scanagati	O
did	O
ask	O
if	O
Malton	O
had	O
previously	O
ever	O
had	O
a	O
similar	O
peculiarity	O
of	O
his	O
urine	O
.	O

Malton	O
replied	O
that	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
young	O
and	O
still	O
inexperienced	O
sexually	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
following	O
a	O
fever	O
he	O
had	O
had	O
the	O
same	O
unusual	O
urine	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
that	O
on	O
one	O
occasion	O
this	O
symptom	O
coincided	O
with	O
certain	O
tumours	O
on	O
the	O
testicles	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
only	O
by	O
chance	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
had	O
recourse	O
to	O
surgery	O
,	O
the	O
reason	O
being	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
also	O
afflicted	O
with	O
a	O
throat	O
infection	O
-	O
to	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
prone	O
-	O
and	O
therefore	O
had	O
his	O
vein	O
opened	O
four	O
times	O
.	O

Thereupon	O
the	O
inflammation	O
subsided	O
,	O
and	O
equally	O
the	O
tumours	O
and	O
sediment	O
disappeared	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
as	O
a	O
youth	O
he	O
had	O
sometimes	O
experienced	O
some	O
difficulty	O
and	O
a	O
burning	O
sensation	O
when	O
urinating	O
,	O
which	O
subsided	O
when	O
his	O
blood	O
was	O
let	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
application	O
of	O
poultices	O
.	O

I	O
observed	O
that	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
his	O
face	O
and	O
body	O
were	O
covered	O
with	O
purplish	O
spots	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
having	O
produced	O

he	O

perhaps	O

His	O

He	O

have	O

fit	O
for	O
the	O

to	O
have	O
been	O
rheumatic	O

Cystitis	O

not	O
uncommon	O
and	O
this	O
could	O
certainly	O
lead	O
to	O
"	O
strangury	O

Perhaps	O
Rockingham	O
suffered	O
from	O
a	O
congenital	O
defect	O
of	O
his	O
urinogenitary	O
system	O
which	O
would	O
result	O
in	O

might	O

Another	O

Rockingham	O
had	O
a	O
urinary	O
infection	O
and	O
certainly	O
suffered	O
from	O
recurrent	O
skin	O

,	O
although	O
it	O
appears	O
from	O
Scanagati	O
'	O
s	O
report	O
that	O
these	O
cleared	O
up	O
when	O
mercury	O
was	O

Certainly	O
the	O
marquis	O
complained	O
often	O
about	O
pains	O
in	O
his	O
side	O

and	O
made	O
no	O

of	O

"	O

He	O
was	O
noticeably	O

he	O
moved	O
into	O
his	O
thirties	O
and	O
only	O

even	O
though	O
he	O
had	O

He	O
found	O
the	O
pains	O
caused	O
by	O
his	O
"	O
old	O
complaint	O
"	O
made	O
him	O
feel	O

he	O
was	O

on	O

it	O
seemed	O
likely	O
to	O
prevent	O
him	O
from	O
attending	O
Parliament	O

38	O
He	O
may	O
well	O
have	O
suffered	O
from	O
a	O
problem	O
with	O
gallstones	O
from	O
an	O
early	O
age	O
.	O
39	O
He	O
appears	O
to	O
have	O
suffered	O
from	O
a	O
nervous	O
disorder	O
which	O
manifested	O
itself	O
in	O
severe	O

constipation	O

Our	O
hypothesis	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
the	O
metal	O
ion	O
in	O
the	O
molecules	O
of	O
these	O
complex	O
inhibitors	O
induces	O
a	O
dramatic	O
change	O
in	O
their	O
physico	O
-	O
chemical	O
properties	O
as	O
compared	O
to	O
those	O
of	O
the	O
parent	O
sulfonamide	O
.	O

This	O
phenomenon	O
is	O
certainly	O
governed	O
by	O
the	O
strong	O
polarization	O
induced	O
by	O
the	O
metal	O
ions	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
quite	O
probable	O
that	O
the	O
right	O
balance	O
between	O
the	O
lipo	O
-	O
and	O
hydrosolubility	O
of	O
these	O
compounds	O
is	O
achieved	O
,	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
considered	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
critical	O
factor	O
for	O
not	O
observing	O
topical	O
activity	O
in	O
the	O
classical	O
CA	O
inhibitors	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
acetazolamide	O

So	O
,	O
by	O
choosing	O
different	O
metal	O
ions	O
and	O
diverse	O
sulfonamides	O
,	O
much	O
larger	O
possibilities	O
arise	O
to	O

the	O

We	O
must	O
acknowledge	O
several	O
potential	O
limitations	O
of	O
this	O
study	O

First	O
,	O
we	O
considered	O
only	O
previous	O

Hence	O
persons	B-Species

elsewhere	O
would	O
be	O
misclassified	O

VOLUME	O

Nevertheless	O
,	O
we	O
identified	O
some	O
interesting	O
interactions	O
.	O

We	O
cannot	O
exclude	O
the	O
possibility	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
areas	O
we	O
missed	O
for	O
this	O
reason	O
.	O

We	O
also	O
examined	O
interactions	O
in	O
a	O
log	O
relative	O
risk	O
model	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
inherently	O
multiplicative	O
.	O

Although	O
we	O
believe	O
this	O
is	O
justified	O
because	O
doubling	O
the	O
population	O
exposed	O
would	O
be	O
expected	O
to	O
double	O
the	O
pollution	O
associated	O
admissions	O
,	O
it	O
results	O
in	O
a	O
more	O
conservative	O
definition	O
of	O
interaction	O
than	O
would	O
an	O
additive	O
risk	O
model	O
.	O

Finally	O
,	O
our	O
exposure	O
is	O
clearly	O
measured	O
with	O
error	O
.	O

Most	O
of	O
this	O
error	O
is	O
Berkson	O
error	O
(	O

and	O
hence	O
will	O
introduce	O
no	O

and	O

that	O
the	O

Abstract	O

Background	O

The	O
syndrome	O
of	O
arachnomelia	O
is	O
an	O
inherited	O
malformation	O
mainly	O
of	O
limbs	O
,	O
back	O
and	O

in	O
cattle	B-Species

At	O

the	O
arachnomelia	O
syndrome	O
has	O
been	O
well	O
known	O
mainly	O
in	O
Brown	O
Swiss	O
cattle	B-Species
.	O

Nevertheless	O
,	O
the	O
arachnomelia	O
syndrome	O
had	O
been	O
observed	O
in	O
the	O
Hessian	O
Simmental	O
population	O
during	O
the	O
decade	O
1964	O
-	O
1974	O
.	O

Recently	O
,	O
stillborn	O
Simmental	O
calves	B-Species
were	O
observed	O
having	O
a	O
morphology	O
similar	O
to	O
the	O
arachnomelia	O
syndrome	O
.	O

The	O
goal	O
of	O
this	O
work	O
was	O
the	O
characterization	O
of	O
the	O
morphology	O
and	O
genealogy	O
of	O
the	O
syndrome	O
in	O
Simmental	O
to	O
establish	O
the	O
basis	O
for	O
an	O

Conclusion	O

We	O
describe	O
the	O
repeated	O
occurrence	O
of	O
the	O
arachnomelia	O
syndrome	O
in	O
Simmental	O
calves	B-Species

It	O
resembles	O
completely	O
the	O
same	O
defect	O
occurring	O
in	O
the	O
Brown	O
Swiss	O
breed	O
.	O

The	O
mutation	O
became	O
relatively	O
widespread	O
amongst	O
the	O
current	O
population	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
a	O
control	O
system	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
established	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
highly	O
desirable	O
to	O

The	O
main	O
pathological	O
changes	O
are	O
skeletal	O
malformations	O
of	O
the	O
legs	O

the	O
spinal	O

The	O
malformation	O
of	O
the	O
spinal	O

leads	O
to	O
kyphosis	O

The	O

The	O

does	O
not	O
become	O
kinked	O
or	O
badly	O
angulated	O
when	O
it	O
is	O
turned	O
down	O
for	O
the	O
anastomosis	O

and	O
a	O
good	O
functional	O
result	O
almost	O
invariably	O
follows	O
the	O
completion	O
of	O
a	O
satisfactory	O

The	O
subclavian	O
which	O
arises	O
directly	O
from	O
the	O
aorta	O
,	O
on	O
the	O

hand	O

tends	O
to	O
form	O
a	O
bad	O

when	O
it	O

the	O
anastomosis	O

,	O
indeed	O
,	O
near	O
its	O

it	O
may	O
be	O
so	O
flattened	O
out	O

the	O
exposure	O

both	O
the	O

the	O
subclavian	O
are	O
easier	O
on	O

in	O
placing	O

the	O

On	O

I	O
had	O
previously	O
toyed	O
with	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
suturing	O
hilar	O
pleura	O
to	O
the	O
mediastinal	O
pleura	O
but	O
had	O
abandoned	O
it	O
as	O
impractical	O
because	O
the	O
sutures	O
seemed	O
to	O
pull	O
out	O
whenever	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
tension	O
whatsoever	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
procedure	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
successful	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
essential	O
that	O
the	O
sutures	O
encompass	O
any	O
adjacent	O
areolar	O
and	O
fibrous	O
tissue	O
and	O
especially	O
the	O

Conclusion	O

We	O

Another	O

the	O

However	O

use	O

the	O

In	O

the	O

There	O
are	O
several	O
advantages	O
to	O

Firstly	O

there	O
is	O
no	O

to	O
prepare	O
multiple	O

This	O
means	O
that	O

that	O
yield	O
good	O
results	O
in	O

easily	O
be	O
accomodated	O

This	O
should	O
make	O
multiplexing	O
more	O
accessible	O
to	O
workers	O
undertaking	O
smaller	O
projects	O
.	O

A	O
theoretical	O
disadvantage	O
of	O
tagged	O

is	O
that	O
the	O

be	O
