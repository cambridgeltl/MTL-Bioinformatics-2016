In	O

,	O
Harold	O
Dvorak	O
and	O
his	O
colleagues	O
were	O
the	O
first	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
tumor	B-Anatomy

secreted	O

(	O

and	O
that	O
a	O

could	O
prevent	O
the	O
edema	S-Anatomy
and	O
fluid	S-Anatomy
accumulation	O
that	O
is	O
characteristic	O
of	O
human	O
cancers	S-Anatomy
.	O

In	O
1986	O
,	O
Dvorak	O
went	O
on	O
to	O
demonstrate	O
that	O
VPF	O
was	O
secreted	O
by	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
human	O
tumor	B-Anatomy
cell	I-Anatomy
lines	E-Anatomy
and	O
proposed	O
that	O
VPF	O
was	O
in	O
part	O
responsible	O
for	O
the	O
abnormal	O
vasculature	S-Anatomy
seen	O
in	O
human	O
tumors	S-Anatomy
.	O

As	O
a	O
result	O
,	O
he	O
and	O
other	O
investigators	O
demonstrated	O
that	O
VPF	O
was	O
capable	O
of	O
stimulating	O
endothelial	B-Anatomy
cell	E-Anatomy
growth	O
and	O
angiogenesis	O
.	O

These	O
fundamental	O
discoveries	O
led	O
to	O
additional	O
research	O
conducted	O
by	O
Napoleone	O
Ferrara	O
and	O
his	O
laboratory	O
,	O
confirming	O
the	O

and	O
renaming	O
the	O

(	O

In	O

,	O
Dvorak	O
proposed	O
that	O
by	O
secreting	O
VPF	O
,	O
tumors	S-Anatomy
induce	O
angiogenesis	O
by	O
turning	O
on	O
the	O
wound	S-Anatomy

He	O
noted	O
that	O
wounds	S-Anatomy
,	O
like	O
tumors	S-Anatomy
,	O
secrete	O
VPF	O
,	O
causing	O
blood	B-Anatomy

to	O
leak	O
plasma	S-Anatomy
fibrinogen	O
,	O
which	O
stimulates	O
blood	B-Anatomy
vessel	E-Anatomy
growth	O
and	O
provides	O
a	O
matrix	O
on	O
which	O
they	O
can	O
spread	O
.	O

Unlike	O
wounds	S-Anatomy
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
turn	O
off	O
VPF	O
production	O
after	O
healing	O
,	O
tumors	S-Anatomy
did	O
not	O
turn	O
off	O
their	O
VPF	O
production	O
and	O
instead	O
continued	O
to	O
make	O
large	O
amounts	O
of	O
VPF	O
,	O
allowing	O
malignant	B-Anatomy
cells	E-Anatomy
to	O
continue	O
to	O
induce	O
new	O
blood	B-Anatomy

and	O
so	O
to	O
grow	O
and	O
spread	O

Thus	O

tumors	S-Anatomy
behave	O
